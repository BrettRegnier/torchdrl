    - Basic manager 
    - Apex manager
    - Agents and Manager
        -- Manager should receive an agent 
        -- Manager should handle the training 
        -- Manager should handle the play episode
        -- What I have now is that The agent does everything
            which makes it impossible to extend it into 
            things that just need its acting ability
        -- Manager should be able to run a factory

    - Plotter 
        - Save graph every x time
        - Clear graph every x time 
    - NN factory 
        - Clean up the creating of NN 
        - Make them more tidy in the way that they should all be in a 
            single sequential group.
