    - Basic manager 
    - Apex manager
    - Agents and Manager
        -- Manager should receive an agent 
        -- Manager should handle the training 
        -- Manager should handle the play episode
        -- What I have now is that The agent does everything
            which makes it impossible to extend it into 
            things that just need its acting ability
        -- Manager should be able to run a factory
